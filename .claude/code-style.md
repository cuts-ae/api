# Code Style Guidelines

## General Rules

- No emojis allowed anywhere in code, comments, documentation, or commit messages
- This is production code - maintain professional standards
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements

## Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed
- Add semicolons at end of statements
- Use trailing commas in objects and arrays

## Documentation

- Write clear, concise comments without emojis or decorative characters
- Document complex logic and business rules
- Keep README and documentation professional and to-the-point

## Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
- No emojis in commit messages
- Be descriptive but concise

Examples:
- `feat: add order cancellation endpoint`
- `fix: resolve authentication token expiration issue`
- `refactor: simplify nutrition calculation logic`
